We can connect to Redshift and Athena to gather the necessary data for training and inference. There are [custom components](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/components/aws/emr) for processing on EMR that we've started to explore for data processing with Spark."

    "Our first use case for Kubeflow at Compass was the Listing Editor Autofill project. This involved training models to infer different fields in a listing, to speed up the agent's workflow as they enter new listings. Training was initially done locally on our team members' laptops, but soon encountered friction around the length of queries to get data, amount of memory used in training, and ability to only train one model at a time. Moving to Kubeflow Pipelines alleviated these issues and cut down on the time needed to deliver new models to the product team.\n",

    "Recently, we have also used it for training and inference of our Likely Seller model, which predicts properties that are likely to sell in the next year. We train a separate model for each city that Compass is in, so training locally, or even on a single instance, can take a long time. Using Kubeflow Pipelines, we were able to achieve better parallelism for the offline scoring job, bringing its running time down from over 4 hours to 26 minutes."
